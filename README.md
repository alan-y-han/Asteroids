# Asteroids
Asteroids game, written in C++11/OpenGL 3.3. Currently developed using Visual Studio 2015, but should compile under linux with minimal changes.

# Dependencies
- GLAD
- GLFW
- Graphics driver supporting OpenGL 3.3 or higher
- GLM

# How to compile
Just open in Visual Studio and compile for x86. All dependencies are under /include and /lib - these folders should already be configured with relative paths in Visual Studio's configuration properties. More details about how to setup these dependencies with Visual Studio can be found [here](https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Creating-a-window).
